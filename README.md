# Twitter Onboarding Flow with Flutter

This project aims to recreate the Twitter onboarding experience using Flutter. The following screens have been implemented:

1. **Initial Screen**: The first screen users see, often serving as an introduction or welcome screen.

-   This is the first screen that the user sees when they open the app. It has three (3) buttons. When the user presses on "Create Account" navigate the user to the "Create Account" screen.

2. **Create Account Screen**: Where users can sign up and create a new account.

-   This screen has a form with inputs for "Name", "Email" and "Date Of Birth".
-   When the user writes on the inputs a green icon should show up next to the input.
-   When all the inputs are filled, the "Next" button should be enabled.
-   When the user presses on "Next" navigate the user to the "Customize Experience" screen.

3. **Customize Experience Screen**: Allows users to personalize their Twitter experience.

-   This screen should have a Switch input and a "Next" button.
-   When the user enables the switch, the "Next" button should be enabled.
